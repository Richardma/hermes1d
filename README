Hermes1D
========

This is a 1D FEM code. The goal is to have an adaptive hp-FEM in 1D, that
should be robust enough to solve any ODE (linear or nonlinear) and fast enough
to compete with any other ODE solver out there.

Currently only a nonadaptive FEM is implemented (any order), more below.

1. Installation
---------------

Install numpy, scipy and matplotlib, e.g. in Debian/Ubuntu:

$ apt-get install git-core python-matplotlib python-numpy python-scipy

Try that it works:

$ python examples/sin.py

This solves y''+y=0 and plots the solution, which is sin(x).

2. Todo
-------

* write thorough tests for the current functionality and test many different
  equations together with checks that the solution is correct
* implement more general way for the user to input any set of ODEs (linear or
  nonlinear)
* implement adaptive hp-FEM refinement
* write the core in C++ and compare with other ODE solvers, do our best to be
  the best. :) E.g. in terms of speed, error control, robustness, ...
