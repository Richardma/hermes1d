Hermes1D
========

This is a 1D FEM code. The goal is to have an adaptive hp-FEM in 1D, that
should be robust enough to solve any ODE (linear or nonlinear) and fast enough
to compete with any other ODE solver out there.

1. Documentation and usage

$ python examples/sin.py

This solves y''+y=0 and plots the solution, which is sin(x).
